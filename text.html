<h1>This is a headline</h1>
<h2>This is the migit of a headline</h2>
<p>Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk</p>
<p>I'm a woman's man, no time to talk</p>
<p>Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around</p>
<p>Since I was born</p>
<p>And now it's alright, it's okay</p>
<p>And you may look the other way</p>
<p>We can try to understand</p>
<p>The New York Times' effect on man</p>
<p>Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother</p>
<p>You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive</p>
<p>Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'</p>
<p>And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive</p>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive</p>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive</p>
<p>Well now, I get low and I get high</p>
<p>And if I can't get either, I really try</p>
<p>Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes</p>
<p>I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose</p>
<p>You know it's alright, it's okay</p>
<p>I'll live to see another day</p>
<p>We can try to understand</p>
<p>The New York Times' effect on man</p>
<p>Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother</p>
<p>You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive</p>
<p>Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'</p>
<p>And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive</p>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive</p>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive (ohh)</p>
<p>Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me</p>
<p>Somebody help me, yeah</p>
<p>Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah</p>
<p>I'm stayin' alive</p>
